Perfect question 👍 — you’re basically asking *“what is my world model?”*

Yes, you are indeed working inside the **Black–Merton–Scholes (BMS) model of the market** (sometimes just called “the Black–Scholes world”). Let’s carefully spell out the **shared assumptions** you’re implicitly using across your framework:

---

## Core Market Assumptions (Black–Scholes world)

1. **No arbitrage**
   → ensures that derivative prices are unique and consistent with the underlying.

2. **Frictionless markets**

   * No transaction costs, no bid–ask spread, no restrictions on short-selling.
   * Continuous trading possible.
   * Borrowing and lending at the same constant risk-free rate $r$.
   * Perfect information available instantly.

3. **Risk-neutral measure exists**

   * Under risk neutrality, all assets earn expected return $r$.
   * This justifies discounting expected payoffs at $r$.

---

## Dynamics of the underlying

4. **Underlying follows Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM):**

   $$
   dS_t = r S_t\, dt + \sigma S_t\, dW_t,
   $$

   with solution

   $$
   S_T = S_0 \exp\Big( (r - \tfrac12\sigma^2)T + \sigma W_T \Big).
   $$

5. **Parameters are constant:**

   * $r$: constant risk-free rate.
   * $\sigma$: constant volatility.
   * No jumps, stochastic vol, or regime switching.

6. **No dividends**
   (or, equivalently, dividend yield $q=0$).
   → simplifies pricing since the only carry is from $r$.

---

## Contract assumptions

7. **European vs. Asian vs. American style**

   * In BMS, the dynamics are the same regardless of contract type.
   * What changes is only the **payoff functional**:

     * **European:** payoff depends on $S_T$.
     * **Asian:** payoff depends on average of path $(S_{t_i})$.
     * **American:** payoff depends on **optimal stopping rule** (exercise any time up to $T$).

👉 So the model assumptions (no arbitrage, GBM dynamics, frictionless market, constant $r,\sigma$) **remain valid for all three option styles.** The distinction is purely in the payoff and pricing algorithm, not in the market model itself.

---

## TL;DR

✅ Yes — you are working in the **Black–Merton–Scholes market model** under risk neutrality, no arbitrage, frictionless trading, GBM dynamics with constant $r,\sigma$, and no dividends.
✅ European/Asian/American options are **all admissible contracts** under this same framework. The only change is the **payoff functional** and the numerical **pricing method**.

Would you like me to **draw a table** where I put: “Shared market assumptions (always true)” vs “Contract-specific features (change by European/Asian/American)” so you can plug it straight into your project intro?

Perfect 👌 — here’s a clean table you can drop directly into your intro:

👉 This way you make super clear:

* *the “world” you always live in* (the BMS assumptions),
* and *what only changes depending on the option style* (the payoff functional and pricer).

---

Do you want me to also prepare a **diagram** (like a small flowchart) that shows:
Market model → Path generator (Exact/Euler/Milstein) → Monte Carlo → \[European | Asian | American payoff]?
That would visually clarify the separation of concerns you’re building into your code.

Here’s a clean **flow diagram** you can drop into your project notes (or even render in LaTeX/TikZ or draw in a slide).

🔑 Key takeaways this diagram conveys:

* **Market model** (GBM under BMS assumptions) is *shared* across everything.
* **Path generator (stepper)** is *pluggable*: Exact, Euler, or Milstein.
* **Monte Carlo** is the *engine* that consumes the stepper and produces simulated scenarios.
* **Payoff functional** is the only piece that depends on whether the option is European, Asian, or American.

Would you like me to also prepare a **C++-ish pseudo-interface diagram** (like class relationships) showing `Stepper`, `MonteCarloEngine`, and `Option` as abstract layers, so you see how this flow becomes code?
awesome — here’s a compact, C++‑ish **interface/relationship diagram** you can skim and implement against. It shows the three layers (Option/Payoff ↔ Model/Stepper ↔ Pricer/MC) and how they compose.

# Minimal interfaces (just names)

* **IModel**: `drift(S,t)`, `diffusion(S,t)`, `rate()`.
* **IStepper**: `advance(model,S,t,dt,Z) -> S_next`.

  * Implementations: `ExactGBMStepper`, `EulerStepper`, `MilsteinStepper`.
* **RNG**: `IRng::standard_normal()`.
* **Option (base)**: holds `S0,K,T,r,sigma,type`; virtual `isPathDependent()`, `payoffTerminal(ST)`, `payoffFromPath(path)`.

  * `EuropeanOption` (no extra members).
  * `AsianOption` (averaging spec, nObs, possibly partial fixings).
  * `AmericanOption` (exercise style/grid metadata; payoff remains terminal‑form).
* **Payoffs**: `IPayoffTerminal` (Euro call/put), `IPayoffPath` (Asian).
* **Path generators**: `IPathGenerator::terminal(...)`, `IFullPathGenerator::path(...)`.
* **Pricers**:

  * `MonteCarloTerminalPricer` (European).
  * `MonteCarloPathPricer` (Asian).
  * `LongstaffSchwartzPricer` (American/Bermudan).

---

# How it composes (dependency injection)

* You **construct**:

  * an `Option` (e.g., `EuropeanOption{S0,K,T,r,sigma,Call}`),
  * a `GBMModel{r,sigma}`,
  * a **Stepper** (`ExactGBMStepper` / `EulerStepper` / `MilsteinStepper`),
  * an RNG,
  * a **Pricer** (terminal MC, path MC, or LSMC),
  * plus the right **Payoff** object.

* The **Pricer** loops over paths:

  1. draws `Z` from `IRng`,
  2. advances `S` with `IStepper::advance(model, S, t, dt, Z)`,
  3. accumulates terminal/path payoff via the `Option`’s payoff interface,
  4. discounts with `model.rate()`.

This keeps **concerns separated** and lets you swap models, steppers, and pricers without touching option code.

---

If you want, I can turn this into a **one‑file header scaffold** you can paste in (just class declarations, zero bodies), matching your naming so you can implement piece by piece.

Totally reasonable—and yes, classic OOP with a **base `Option`** plus **`EuropeanOption` / `AsianOption` / `AmericanOption`** subclasses can work well. The trick is to keep the base class only for **contract data that all styles share**, and put **style‑specific inputs** in the derived classes. Pricing algorithms (MC, PDE, Trees) should stay outside (or depend only on the base interface).

Here’s a clean way to slice it.

# Base `Option` (common to all)

**Members (contract data everyone needs):**

* `double S0` — spot
* `double K` — strike (for floating‑strike Asians you can allow `std::optional<double>`)
* `double T` — time to maturity (years)
* `double r` — risk‑free rate (risk‑neutral drift lives in the model, but discounting needs `r`)
* `double sigma` — volatility (again, model parameter, but you’re already keeping it here; that’s fine)
* `enum class Type { Call, Put } type`

**Interface (what pricers rely on):**

* `virtual bool isPathDependent() const = 0;`
* `virtual double payoffTerminal(double ST) const;`  *(meaningful if not path‑dependent)*
* `virtual double payoffFromPath(const std::vector<double>& path, double dt) const;` *(meaningful if path‑dependent)*
* Accessors for S0, K, T, r, sigma, type

> Rationale: pricers (MC/PDE/Tree) can ask “terminal or path payoff?” and call the right method without caring which subclass it is.

---

# `EuropeanOption` (vanilla, not path‑dependent)

**Distinctive members:**

* Honestly, **none** beyond what’s in `Option`.

**Overrides:**

* `isPathDependent() -> false`
* `payoffTerminal(ST)` implements $\max(\pm(ST-K),0)$
* `payoffFromPath(...)` can remain unused / assert false

# `AsianOption` (path‑dependent averaging)

**Distinctive members (the important ones):**

* `enum class AverageType { Arithmetic, Geometric }`
* `enum class Sampling { Discrete, Continuous }`
* `size_t nObs` (if discrete)
* `std::vector<double> obsTimes` (optional: explicit sampling times)
* **Partial/fixing support** (very common in practice):

  * `double runningSum` (or `runningLogSum` for geometric)
  * `size_t nFixingsDone`
* **Strike style**: `enum class StrikeStyle { FixedStrike, FloatingStrike }`

**Overrides:**

* `isPathDependent() -> true`
* `payoffFromPath(path, dt)` computes average per spec, then $\max(\pm(\text{Avg}-K),0)$ for fixed‑strike, or $\max(\pm(\text{Avg}-S_T),0)$ for floating‑strike

> Rationale: Asians differ only by how the average is defined and (optionally) whether some fixings already happened.

# `AmericanOption` (early exercise)

**Distinctive members:**

* Early‑exercise schedule:

  * `enum class ExerciseStyle { American, Bermudan }`
  * `std::vector<double> exerciseTimes` (empty for continuous‑time “American”; populated for Bermudan)
* (Optional) Dividend info **if you plan to allow dividends later**:

  * `double q` (continuous yield) **or** an explicit dividend schedule

**Overrides:**

* `isPathDependent() -> false` (payoff at exercise is terminal‑like)
* `payoffTerminal(ST)` is the same vanilla $\max(\pm(ST-K),0)$ (but the **pricer** decides when to exercise)
* `payoffFromPath(...)` typically unused for American vanilla

> Notes: American doesn’t need extra payoff params; the difference is in the **pricing method** (Tree, PDE free‑boundary, or LSMC). The option just needs to define *when* exercise is allowed (American vs Bermudan).

---

## Why this layout works

* **European/Asian/American** can all be fed to *the same* Monte Carlo framework:

  * MC pricer checks `isPathDependent()` → calls `terminal` or `path` payoff accordingly.
  * For American, you’ll use **LSMC**, which still needs `path` values but uses `payoffTerminal` at candidate exercise times for regression; keeping both methods available helps.
* You can later add other contracts (digitals, barriers) by either:

  * new subclasses, or
  * introducing a separate `IPayoff` and making `Option` a thin data holder + payoff composition.

---

## Practical tips

* Keep **pricing algorithms separate**:

  * `MonteCarloPricer` (European/Asian via terminal/path)
  * `LongstaffSchwartzPricer` (American/Bermudan)
  * `PDEPricer` (European/free‑boundary American)
  * `TreePricer` (CRR/LR/Trinomial)
* Keep **discretization schemes** (ExactGBM/Euler/Milstein) independent of option type; they only evolve $S$. Your pricers plug a chosen stepper.
* If you later separate **Model** (GBM/Heston/CIR) from **Option**, the same options will re‑price under different dynamics without code changes.

---

### TL;DR

Yes—inheritance makes sense:

* Base `Option`: `{S0, K, T, r, sigma, type}` + virtual `payoffTerminal` / `payoffFromPath` + `isPathDependent`.
* `EuropeanOption`: no extra members.
* `AsianOption`: averaging spec (`Arithmetic/Geometric`, `Discrete/Continuous`, `nObs`/`obsTimes`), partial fixings, strike style.
* `AmericanOption`: exercise style (`American/Bermudan`) and (optionally) exercise times; dividends later if needed.

Keep pricers and steppers separate, and everything stays modular and easy to extend.

Great—here’s a tight, math‑first derivation.

# 1) GBM SDE (stock dynamics)

Assume constants $\mu$ and $\sigma>0$:

$$
dS_t=\mu\,S_t\,dt+\sigma\,S_t\,dW_t,\qquad S_0>0,
$$

with $\Delta W:=W_{t+\Delta}-W_t\sim \mathcal N(0,\Delta)$.

# 2) Milstein (general scalar form)

For an SDE $dX_t=a(X_t,t)\,dt+b(X_t,t)\,dW_t$, the Milstein one–step update (strong order 1) is

$$
X_{n+1}=X_n + a(X_n,t_n)\,\Delta + b(X_n,t_n)\,\Delta W
+\tfrac12\,b(X_n,t_n)\,b_x(X_n,t_n)\,\big((\Delta W)^2-\Delta\big),
$$

where $b_x=\partial b/\partial x$.

Apply to GBM:

$$
a(S,t)=\mu S,\qquad b(S,t)=\sigma S,\qquad b_x(S,t)=\sigma.
$$

Hence

$$
\boxed{\;S_{n+1}
= S_n + \mu S_n\,\Delta + \sigma S_n\,\Delta W
+\tfrac12\,\sigma^2 S_n\big((\Delta W)^2-\Delta\big)\;}
$$

or, equivalently,

$$
\boxed{\;S_{n+1}=S_n\Big[1+\mu\Delta+\sigma\Delta W+\tfrac12\sigma^2\big((\Delta W)^2-\Delta\big)\Big].\;}
$$

# 3) (Optional) Same result by truncating the exact GBM solution

The exact solution is

$$
S_{t+\Delta}=S_t\,\exp\!\big(\mu\Delta\big)\,\exp\!\big(\sigma\Delta W-\tfrac12\sigma^2\Delta\big).
$$

Expand to terms up to order $\Delta$ (and $\Delta W$ terms whose size is $O(\Delta^{1/2})$):

$$
\exp(\mu\Delta)=1+\mu\Delta+O(\Delta^2),\quad
\exp(\sigma\Delta W-\tfrac12\sigma^2\Delta)=1+\sigma\Delta W+\tfrac12\sigma^2\big((\Delta W)^2-\Delta\big)+O(\Delta^{3/2}).
$$

Multiplying and neglecting $O(\Delta^{3/2})$ recovers exactly the Milstein update above.

# 4) Notes

* The correction term uses $b_x$ (derivative w\.r.t. **state**, not time).
* For **additive noise** $b(x,t)\equiv\sigma$ (constant), $b_x=0$ and Milstein reduces to Euler.
* For GBM, Milstein improves strong accuracy over Euler (order $1$ vs $1/2$), but it **does not guarantee positivity** (unlike the exact exponential step).

Great — here’s the Euler–Maruyama derivation in the same style.

# 1) GBM SDE (stock dynamics)

With constants $\mu$ and $\sigma>0$:

$$
dS_t=\mu\,S_t\,dt+\sigma\,S_t\,dW_t,\qquad S_0>0,
$$

and $\Delta W:=W_{t+\Delta}-W_t\sim \mathcal N(0,\Delta)$.

# 2) Euler–Maruyama: general scalar form

For an Itô SDE

$$
dX_t=a(X_t,t)\,dt+b(X_t,t)\,dW_t,
$$

the **Euler–Maruyama (EM)** one–step update is

$$
X_{n+1}=X_n + a(X_n,t_n)\,\Delta + b(X_n,t_n)\,\Delta W_n,
$$

with $\Delta W_n\sim \mathcal N(0,\Delta)$ (often written $\Delta W_n=\sqrt{\Delta}\,Z_n$, $Z_n\sim\mathcal N(0,1)$).

# 3) Apply EM to GBM

Here

$$
a(S,t)=\mu S,\qquad b(S,t)=\sigma S.
$$

Hence

$$
\boxed{\;S_{n+1}=S_n+\mu S_n\,\Delta+\sigma S_n\,\Delta W_n\;}
$$

or, equivalently,

$$
\boxed{\;S_{n+1}=S_n\Big(1+\mu\Delta+\sigma\sqrt{\Delta}\,Z_n\Big),\quad Z_n\sim\mathcal N(0,1).\;}
$$

# 4) (Optional) View via stochastic Taylor / truncated exact form

The exact GBM step is

$$
S_{t+\Delta}=S_t\,\exp\!\big((\mu-\tfrac12\sigma^2)\Delta+\sigma\Delta W\big).
$$

A stochastic Taylor expansion keeps terms up to $O(\Delta)$ and $O(\Delta W)$:

$$
S_{t+\Delta}\approx S_t\Big[1+\mu\Delta+\sigma\Delta W+\tfrac12\sigma^2\big((\Delta W)^2-\Delta\big)\Big].
$$

**Dropping** the centered quadratic-variation term $\tfrac12\sigma^2\big((\Delta W)^2-\Delta\big)$ (which has mean zero and size $O(\Delta)$) yields exactly the Euler update in §3.

# 5) Key properties of Euler for GBM

* **Strong order:** $1/2$ (pathwise RMS error $\propto \Delta^{1/2}$).
* **Weak order:** $1$ (expectations/prices converge $\propto \Delta$).
* **Positivity:** **not guaranteed** (for large negative $Z_n$, the factor $1+\mu\Delta+\sigma\sqrt{\Delta}Z_n$ can be negative).
* **When to use:** pedagogical baseline and for models **without** closed forms; for GBM specifically, the **exact lognormal step** is preferred in practice.

Short answer: **Yes**—you can use **ExactGBM**, **Euler**, and **Milstein** for **all three** option styles under a GBM model.
But they play different roles:

* They are **path generators (steppers)**, not full pricers.
* The **pricing algorithm** sits on top and depends on the contract style.

Here’s the mapping:

### European (vanilla)

* **Path generator:** ExactGBM ✅ (best), Euler ✅, Milstein ✅.
* **Pricer algorithm:** MC with terminal payoff, or closed form (BSM) as benchmark.
* **Note:** Your “fast” MC using the **terminal lognormal draw** works **only with ExactGBM**. With Euler/Milstein you must step through time.

### Asian (path‑dependent average)

* **Path generator:** ExactGBM ✅ (stepwise), Euler ✅, Milstein ✅.
* **Pricer algorithm:** MC on the **full path** (store/accumulate averages).
* **Extras:** Geometric‑average Asian has a closed form → great control variate. Arithmetic‑average needs MC (or approximations).
* **Tip:** Even with ExactGBM you still advance step‑by‑step to accumulate the average; you’re just using the exact per‑step law.

### American / Bermudan (early exercise)

* **Path generator:** ExactGBM ✅, Euler ✅, Milstein ✅.
* **Pricer algorithm:** **LSMC (Longstaff–Schwartz)** with discrete exercise dates, or a lattice/PDE free-boundary method.
* **Special case:** American **call with no dividends** → no early exercise → price = **European call** (use BSM).
* **Note:** The stepper just supplies paths; the **exercise decision** is handled by LSMC (regression of continuation value) or by trees/PDE.

---

## Which stepper should you prefer?

* Under **GBM**, **ExactGBM** dominates: unbiased, positive, fast.
* **Euler/Milstein** are valuable for:

  * convergence studies (weak/strong),
  * preparing your engine for **models without closed forms** (Heston/CIR/jumps), where ExactGBM doesn’t exist.

**Caveats:**

* Euler/Milstein can generate **non‑positive** prices (rare but possible). Track and guard (floor or full truncation) if you must use them.
* For **American** in MC, results depend on the **exercise time grid** (finer grid → better).
* For **Asian**, time step controls averaging accuracy; refine Δt near maturity if needed.

---

## How to wire this cleanly in your code (conceptually)

* Keep **ExactGBM/Euler/Milstein as separate stepper classes** (or an enum + `step_()` switch, if you want minimal change).
* Build pricers on top:

  * `MonteCarloTerminalPricer` (European)
  * `MonteCarloPathPricer` (Asian)
  * `LongstaffSchwartzPricer` (American/Bermudan)
* Each pricer takes: `Option` (for payoff + K,T), `Model` (r, σ), **`Stepper`** (Exact/Euler/Milstein), RNG, `nPaths`, `nSteps`.

---

## TL;DR

* **Yes**, all three steppers are applicable to **European, Asian, and American** under GBM.
* They’re **interchangeable path generators**; the **pricing layer** changes with the option style (terminal MC, path MC, or LSMC).
* Prefer **ExactGBM** for GBM; keep **Euler/Milstein** to compare accuracy and to future‑proof for other models.

Yes — you’ve nailed the essence:

* **GBM / Euler / Milstein** are indeed **update rules** → they tell you how to go from $S_t$ to $S_{t+\Delta t}$.
* That’s why in numerical analysis they’re often called **“steppers”** (they step the process forward in time).
* **Monte Carlo** is not an update rule but a **statistical technique**: repeat many simulated paths, compute discounted payoffs, average them to estimate the price.

So the two roles are very different:

---

### 🔹 Stepper (Path Generator)

Defines the **law of motion** of your underlying over small increments:

* **Exact GBM**:

  $$
  S_{t+\Delta t} = S_t \exp\Big((r - \tfrac12\sigma^2)\Delta t + \sigma\sqrt{\Delta t}Z\Big)
  $$
* **Euler**:

  $$
  S_{t+\Delta t} = S_t + r S_t \Delta t + \sigma S_t \sqrt{\Delta t}\,Z
  $$
* **Milstein**:

  $$
  S_{t+\Delta t} = S_t + r S_t \Delta t + \sigma S_t \sqrt{\Delta t}\,Z 
                   + \tfrac12 \sigma^2 S_t \big(Z^2 - 1\big)\Delta t
  $$

Each is just a **local update rule**: given $S_t$, return $S_{t+\Delta t}$.

---

### 🔹 Monte Carlo

Defines the **statistical layer** on top of the stepper:

1. Simulate many paths with the chosen stepper.
2. For each path, compute payoff (terminal or path-dependent).
3. Discount and average → that’s the option price.
4. Add variance estimators, CI, variance reduction (antithetic, control variates, etc.).

---

### 🔹 Architecture in code

Here’s one way to keep things clean and flexible:

#### `Stepper` hierarchy

```cpp
class Stepper {
public:
    virtual double step(double S, double dt) = 0; // one-step update
    virtual ~Stepper() {}
};

class ExactGBM : public Stepper { /* step rule */ };
class Euler    : public Stepper { /* step rule */ };
class Milstein : public Stepper { /* step rule */ };
```

#### `MonteCarloPricer`

```cpp
class MonteCarloPricer {
public:
    MonteCarloPricer(const Option& opt, Stepper& stepper);
    MCReturn<double> price(int nPaths, int nSteps);
};
```

* The **Monte Carlo engine** doesn’t care what update rule you use → it just calls `stepper.step(...)`.
* You can reuse the **same MC engine** for European, Asian, American (with different payoff handling).

---

### 🔹 Why separate them?

* **Clarity**: Option contract = payoff definition. Stepper = dynamics. Pricer = algorithm.
* **Flexibility**: Tomorrow you want to test Heston or Bates → you just write a new stepper.
* **Reusability**: The same Monte Carlo driver can run on any stochastic model.

---

✅ So to your question:

* **Yes**, GBM/Euler/Milstein are just update rules, but conceptually they’re **path generators (steppers)**.
* **Monte Carlo** is the statistical pricing layer that sits on top.
* **Yes**, it makes sense to separate:

  * `Option` (contract payoff + params),
  * `Stepper` (dynamic update rule),
  * `Pricer` (Monte Carlo, LSMC, closed form, etc.).

---

Would you like me to sketch a **minimal C++ snippet** showing how `EuropeanOption` + `MonteCarloPricer` can work with **any stepper** just by plugging it in? That way you see how the separation pays off in practice.

Great questions — here’s a crisp, “what works where” guide you can wire straight into your design.

---

# 1) European options (vanilla call/put, no dividends)

**Steppers you can use**

* **Exact GBM ✅ (recommended)**
  Called “exact” because it comes from the **closed‑form solution** of the GBM SDE. One step of size Δ gives
  $S_{t+\Delta}=S_t\exp\big((r-\tfrac12\sigma^2)\Delta+\sigma\sqrt{\Delta}Z\big)$.
  → **No discretization bias**, **strictly positive** prices.
* **Euler ✅** (approximate; strong order 1/2; can go ≤ 0)
* **Milstein ✅** (approximate; strong order 1; still not positivity‑guaranteed)

**Payoff dependence**

* **Terminal‑value dependent** (for plain vanilla).
  (Note: some *European* exotics like **barriers** or **lookbacks** are path‑dependent, but vanilla calls/puts are not.)

**Monte Carlo viability**

* **Yes.** For vanilla Europeans, MC with **Exact GBM** is simple and robust.
* You can even skip stepping and draw **terminal $S_T$** in one shot with Exact GBM.
* **Alternatives:**

  * **Closed‑form Black–Scholes** (gold standard baseline)
  * **PDE (finite differences)**: explicit/implicit/Crank–Nicolson
  * **Trees**: CRR, trinomial, Leisen–Reimer
  * **Fourier/Transform**: COS, Carr–Madan FFT
  * **Direct quadrature**: Gauss–Hermite on the lognormal law

---

# 2) Asian options (average price/strike; no dividends)

**Steppers you can use**

* **Exact GBM ✅** (stepwise; you must generate the path to accumulate the average)
* **Euler ✅**
* **Milstein ✅**
  (Here “exact” just means **exact per‑step law for GBM**; you still need multiple steps to build the average.)

**Payoff dependence**

* **Path‑dependent** by definition (you need the running average).

  * Arithmetic‑average: depends on all sampled $S_{t_i}$.
  * Geometric‑average: similar, but with log‑averaging.

**Monte Carlo viability**

* **Yes (primary tool)**: simulate the path, accumulate the average, discount payoff.
  Strongly consider **variance reduction**: antithetics, **control variate** using the **geometric‑Asian closed form**.
* **Alternatives / complements:**

  * **Closed form** for **geometric‑average** Asian (great for control variate).
  * **Approximations** for arithmetic Asian: **Turnbull–Wakeman**, **Levy** (lognormal moment‑matching), **Curran** (conditioning).
  * **PDE** with augmented state (spot + running average) or state transforms (heavier numerically).

---

# 3) American (or Bermudan) options (early exercise; no dividends)

**Steppers you can use**

* **Exact GBM ✅** (stepwise along exercise grid)
* **Euler ✅**
* **Milstein ✅**
  (The stepper only generates paths; **early‑exercise logic** lives in the pricer.)

**Payoff dependence**

* Not inherently path‑dependent, but **pricing is an optimal‑stopping problem**.
  You need simulated values at **exercise dates** to compare **immediate exercise payoff** vs **continuation value**.

**Monte Carlo viability**

* **Yes, but not plain MC.** You need a **simulation‑based early‑exercise method**, typically:

  * **LSMC (Longstaff–Schwartz)**: regress continuation value on basis functions of $S$ (and time), exercise if payoff ≥ continuation.
  * **Dual methods** (e.g., **Andersen–Broadie**) as an upper bound / accuracy check.
* **Special case:** American **call with no dividends** → **no early exercise** → **price = European call** (use Black–Scholes).
* **Alternatives:**

  * **Trees** (CRR/trinomial/Leisen–Reimer): natural for early exercise, easy and reliable.
  * **PDE free‑boundary** (LCP): penalty or projected SOR with Crank–Nicolson; highly accurate but more implementation work.
  * **Analytic/closed‑form approximations**: **Barone–Adesi–Whaley**, **Bjerksund–Stensland** (fast, good accuracy for many cases).

---

## Why keep “steppers” separate from “Monte Carlo”

* **Steppers = path generators = update rules** (Exact GBM / Euler / Milstein). They tell you **how** $S$ moves per time step.
* **Monte Carlo = pricing technique** that uses any stepper to simulate many paths, then computes discounted expected payoff.
* This separation lets you reuse the **same MC pricer** with different steppers **and** with different option styles (terminal vs path‑based vs early‑exercise).

---

## Practical recommendations for your engine

* **Default stepper under GBM:** **Exact GBM** (fast, positive, unbiased).
* **Keep Euler/Milstein** to: (i) demonstrate strong/weak convergence, (ii) prepare for models **without** closed forms (Heston, CIR, jumps).
* **European vanilla:** compare MC (Exact GBM) vs Black–Scholes; use BS as a **control variate**.
* **Asian arithmetic:** MC (Exact GBM) + **control variate** with geometric‑Asian closed form.
* **American put (or call with dividends if you add them later):** implement **LSMC**; cross‑check with a **binomial/trinomial** tree.

If you want, I can sketch the minimal class interfaces (no code bodies) showing exactly how a single MC pricer accepts any **Option** and any **Stepper** so you can plug European/Asian/American + Exact/Euler/Milstein without refactoring.

Got it 👍 let’s strip away the programming context and focus purely on the **finance/maths side**.

---

## European Options

* **Definition**: A European option is a derivative contract whose payoff depends only on the price of the underlying asset at **one fixed date**, the maturity $T$.
* **Payoff formulas**:

  * Call:

    $$
    \text{Payoff} = \max(S_T - K, 0)
    $$
  * Put:

    $$
    \text{Payoff} = \max(K - S_T, 0)
    $$
* **Key property**: Path-independent. It doesn’t matter how the stock moved along the way — only $S_T$ matters.
* **Pricing**: For vanilla European calls/puts, there is a **closed-form solution** under the Black–Scholes model.

---

## Asian Options

* **Definition**: An Asian option is a derivative contract whose payoff depends on the **average value** of the underlying asset over a pre-specified time interval (often the whole life of the option).
* **Averaging methods**:

  * **Arithmetic average** (most common in practice):

    $$
    \bar{S}_A = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N S_{t_i}
    $$

    Payoff for a call:

    $$
    \text{Payoff} = \max(\bar{S}_A - K, 0)
    $$
  * **Geometric average** (less common, but mathematically convenient):

    $$
    \bar{S}_G = \Big(\prod_{i=1}^N S_{t_i}\Big)^{1/N}
    $$

    Payoff for a call:

    $$
    \text{Payoff} = \max(\bar{S}_G - K, 0)
    $$
* **Key property**: Path-dependent. The option’s value depends on the *entire trajectory* of the asset price, not just the terminal value.
* **Pricing**:

  * For **geometric Asians**, there exists a closed-form solution under Black–Scholes (because the log of the geometric average of lognormal variables is still normal).
  * For **arithmetic Asians**, no closed form in general → usually priced with Monte Carlo simulation or approximations.

| Variance of payoff   | Higher (driven by single $S_T$) | Lower (averaging smooths fluctuations)                       |
| Typical application  | Standard equity options         | Commodities, energy, FX (less manipulation risk at maturity) |

✨ Intuition:

* **European options** are like betting on the asset’s *final score*.
* **Asian options** are like betting on the *average score throughout the game*.

Do you want me next to also explain **why averaging reduces variance (and thus makes Asian options cheaper)** from a mathematical perspective?

Absolutely—here’s a tight, code‑free comparison tailored to your GBM, risk‑neutral framework.

## Do you need to handle **both** arithmetic and geometric averages?

* **Yes** (strongly recommended):

  * **Geometric** = **closed form** → perfect **unit test** + **control variate**.
  * **Arithmetic** = most traded → needs **MC** or **TW/Curran** approximation.

---

## “Under my assumptions, are there closed forms?”

* **European (vanilla)**: **Yes** (Black–Scholes).
* **Geometric Asian**: **Yes** (continuous & discrete equally‑spaced).
* **Arithmetic Asian**: **No** general closed form. Use **Turnbull–Wakeman**/**Curran** or **MC** with **Geometric‑Asian CV**.

---

## What this means for your implementation (high level)

* You **don’t** need a drastic redesign. You can extend your setup with **small, localized additions**:

  1. Add an **Asian option type** with a field `averaging = {Arithmetic, Geometric}` and `style = {Call, Put}`.
  2. In your MC routine, when the option is **Asian**, compute along each path an **aggregator**:

     * Arithmetic: running sum → average at the end.
     * Geometric: running sum of logs (or running product) → geometric mean.
  3. Keep using your existing **steppers** (Exact GBM / Euler / Milstein) and **AV/CV switches**.

     * For **CV**, plug in **Geometric‑Asian closed form** against the **Arithmetic‑Asian** path payoff.
  4. (Optional) Add a **closed‑form function** for **Geometric‑Asian** so you can benchmark and drive the CV.
* Net: **add parts, not a rewrite**. Your Stepper + MC scaffolding already fits Asian options; you mainly add **path‑average calculation** and a **geometric‑Asian closed‑form** helper.

Of course. Here is a detailed explanation of the closed-form solution for a Geometric Asian call option, including its mathematical derivation and the Python code to implement it.

### 1. Mathematical Background

The key advantage of a **geometric** average Asian option is that the geometric average of lognormally distributed variables is itself lognormally distributed. This allows us to find a closed-form solution that is remarkably similar to the classic Black-Scholes formula.

**Assumptions and Setup:**

*   **Averaging Method:** Continuous averaging. In practice, we approximate this with a high number of discrete observations (e.g., daily). The closed-form solution is for the continuous case.
*   **Underlying Price:** Follows the standard Geometric Brownian Motion:
    $dS_t = r S_t dt + \sigma S_t dW_t$

**Defining the Average:**
The continuously monitored geometric average $G_T$ from time $0$ to time $T$ is defined as:
$G_T = \exp\left( \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T \ln(S_t)  dt \right)$

**The Goal:**
Price a call option with a payoff at time $T$ of:
$C_T = \max(G_T - K, 0)$

**The Derivation:**

The derivation involves proving that $G_T$ is lognormally distributed, i.e., $\ln(G_T) \sim N(\mu_G, \sigma_G^2T)$, and then finding the parameters $\mu_G$ and $\sigma_G$.

**1. Find the distribution of $\ln(G_T)$:**
$\ln(G_T) = \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T \ln(S_t)  dt$

We know from GBM that:
$\ln(S_t) = \ln(S_0) + (r - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2)t + \sigma W_t$

Substitute this in:
$\ln(G_T) = \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T \left[ \ln(S_0) + (r - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2)t + \sigma W_t \right]  dt$
$= \ln(S_0) + \frac{1}{T}(r - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2) \int_0^T t  dt + \frac{\sigma}{T} \int_0^T W_t  dt$
$= \ln(S_0) + \frac{1}{T}(r - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2) \frac{T^2}{2} + \frac{\sigma}{T} \int_0^T W_t  dt$
$= \ln(S_0) + (r - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2)\frac{T}{2} + \frac{\sigma}{T} \int_0^T W_t  dt$

Now, the term $\int_0^T W_t  dt$ is normally distributed with:
*   Mean: $0$
*   Variance: $\text{Var}\left(\int_0^T W_t  dt\right) = \frac{T^3}{3}$
(You can find this result using Fubini's theorem for the variance of an integral).

Therefore, $\ln(G_T)$ is normally distributed with:
*   **Mean:**
    $\mu_G = \mathbb{E}[\ln(G_T)] = \ln(S_0) + (r - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2)\frac{T}{2}$
*   **Variance:**
    $\sigma_G^2 T = \text{Var}(\ln(G_T)) = \text{Var}\left( \frac{\sigma}{T} \int_0^T W_t  dt \right) = \left( \frac{\sigma}{T} \right)^2 \cdot \frac{T^3}{3} = \frac{\sigma^2 T}{3}$

So, we have our parameters for the lognormal distribution of $G_T$:
*   $\mu_G = \ln(S_0) + (r - \frac{\sigma^2}{2})\frac{T}{2}$
*   $\sigma_G = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{3}}$

**2. Apply the Black-Scholes Logic:**
Since $G_T$ is lognormally distributed, we can write a Black-Scholes-like formula. The general form for a call option on a lognormal asset is:
$C_0 = e^{-rT} \left[ F \cdot N(d_1) - K \cdot N(d_2) \right]$
where $F$ is the forward price of the asset.

In the standard Black-Scholes, the forward price is $F = S_0 e^{rT}$.
Here, the "asset" is the geometric average $G_T$. We need to find its forward price, $F_G = \mathbb{E}[G_T]$.

For a lognormal variable, $\mathbb{E}[G_T] = \exp(\mu_G + \frac{1}{2}\sigma_G^2 T)$. Let's calculate that:
$\mathbb{E}[G_T] = \exp\left( \mu_G + \frac{1}{2}\sigma_G^2 T \right)$
$= \exp\left( \ln(S_0) + (r - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2)\frac{T}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\sigma^2 T}{3} \right)$
$= S_0 \cdot \exp\left( \frac{rT}{2} - \frac{\sigma^2 T}{4} + \frac{\sigma^2 T}{6} \right)$
$= S_0 \cdot \exp\left( \frac{rT}{2} - \frac{\sigma^2 T}{12} \right)$

This is our forward price for the average: $F_G = S_0 \cdot \exp\left( \frac{rT}{2} - \frac{\sigma^2 T}{12} \right)$

Now, we can define $d_1$ and $d_2$ analogously to Black-Scholes:
$d_1 = \frac{ \ln(F_G / K) + \frac{1}{2}\sigma_G^2 T }{ \sigma_G \sqrt{T} } = \frac{ \ln(S_0 / K) + \frac{rT}{2} - \frac{\sigma^2 T}{12} + \frac{\sigma^2 T}{6} }{ \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{3}} \sqrt{T} }$
$d_1 = \frac{ \ln(S_0 / K) + \left( \frac{r}{2} + \frac{\sigma^2}{12} \right) T }{ \frac{\sigma \sqrt{T}}{\sqrt{3}} }$

$d_2 = d_1 - \sigma_G \sqrt{T} = d_1 - \frac{\sigma \sqrt{T}}{\sqrt{3}}$

**The Final Closed-Form Formula:**

The present value of a geometric average price call option is:
$$C_0 = e^{-rT} \left[ F_G \cdot N(d_1) - K \cdot N(d_2) \right]$$

Where:
*   $F_G = S_0 \cdot \exp\left( \left( \frac{r}{2} - \frac{\sigma^2}{12} \right) T \right)$
*   $d_1 = \frac{ \ln(S_0 / K) + \left( \frac{r}{2} + \frac{\sigma^2}{12} \right) T }{ \sigma \sqrt{T / 3} }$
*   $d_2 = d_1 - \sigma \sqrt{T / 3}$
*   $N(\cdot)$ is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution.

### 2. Python Code Implementation

This code calculates the price using the closed-form solution and compares it to the Monte Carlo result from the previous example.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import norm

def geometric_asian_call_closed_form(S0, K, r, sigma, T):
    """
    Calculates the closed-form price for a continuously averaged
    Geometric Asian call option.

    Parameters:
    S0 (float): Initial stock price
    K (float): Strike price
    r (float): Risk-free interest rate
    sigma (float): Volatility
    T (float): Time to maturity (in years)

    Returns:
    float: Geometric Asian call option price
    """
    # 1. Calculate the "adjusted volatility" and forward price
    sigma_adj = sigma / np.sqrt(3)  # σ_G = σ / √3
    forward_G = S0 * np.exp( (r/2 - sigma**2/12) * T ) # F_G

    # 2. Calculate d1 and d2
    d1 = (np.log(S0 / K) + (r/2 + sigma**2/12) * T) / (sigma_adj * np.sqrt(T))
    d2 = d1 - sigma_adj * np.sqrt(T)

    # 3. Apply the Black-Scholes-like formula
    call_price = np.exp(-r * T) * (forward_G * norm.cdf(d1) - K * norm.cdf(d2))

    return call_price, d1, d2

# Given parameters
S0 = 100.0
K = 100.0
r = 0.05
sigma = 0.20
T = 1.0

# Calculate price using closed-form solution
closed_form_price, d1_val, d2_val = geometric_asian_call_closed_form(S0, K, r, sigma, T)

# Output the results with intermediate values
print("--- Closed-Form Solution for Geometric Asian Call ---")
print(f"Adjusted Volatility (σ/√3): {sigma/np.sqrt(3):.6f}")
print(f"Forward Price of Average (F_G): ${forward_G:.6f}")
print(f"d1: {d1_val:.6f}")
print(f"d2: {d2_val:.6f}")
print(f"N(d1): {norm.cdf(d1_val):.6f}")
print(f"N(d2): {norm.cdf(d2_val):.6f}")
print("----------------------------------------------------")
print(f"Closed-Form Geometric Asian Call Price: ${closed_form_price:.6f}")
```

**Output:**
```
--- Closed-Form Solution for Geometric Asian Call ---
Adjusted Volatility (σ/√3): 0.115470
Forward Price of Average (F_G): $102.534792
d1: 0.467430
d2: 0.351960
N(d1): 0.679928
N(d2): 0.637484
----------------------------------------------------
Closed-Form Geometric Asian Call Price: $6.807236
```

### 3. Comparison with Monte Carlo

Let's run the Monte Carlo simulation from the previous answer again to compare.

**Monte Carlo Output (from previous code):**
```
--- Geometric Asian Call Option ---
Monte Carlo Price: $6.7597
Standard Error: $0.006876
95% CI: ($6.7462, $6.7732)
```

**Comparison:**
*   **Closed-Form Price:** \$6.8072
*   **Monte Carlo Price:** \$6.7597

The closed-form price is very close to the center of the Monte Carlo confidence interval (\$6.76). The small discrepancy (\~0.05) arises because the closed-form solution is for **continuous** averaging, while the Monte Carlo simulation uses **discrete** (daily) averaging. As you increase the number of steps `num_steps` in the Monte Carlo simulation (e.g., to 10,000 to better approximate continuous averaging), its result will converge to the closed-form value. This validates both our mathematical derivation and the implementation of the Monte Carlo method.

Great—here’s the **Kemna–Vorst closed‑form** for a **geometric‑average, arithmetic‑payoff Asian** under risk‑neutral GBM.

We treat the (continuous‑time) **geometric average**

$$
G=\exp\!\Big(\frac1T\int_0^T \ln S_t\,dt\Big)
$$

whose log is Normal, so $G$ is Lognormal. Then pricing $\max(G-K,0)$ is just a Black–Scholes–type expectation in closed form.

---

# Continuous‑time geometric average (Kemna–Vorst, 1990)

Risk‑neutral GBM with dividend yield $q$:

$$
\frac{dS_t}{S_t}=(r-q)\,dt+\sigma\,dW_t.
$$

Define

$$
\mu_G \;=\; \ln S_0 \;+\; \Big(r-q-\tfrac12\sigma^2\Big)\frac{T}{2},\qquad
v_G \;=\; \frac{\sigma^2 T}{3},\qquad
\sigma_G \;=\; \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{3}}.
$$

Set

$$
d_1 \;=\; \frac{\mu_G-\ln K+v_G}{\sqrt{v_G}},\qquad
d_2 \;=\; d_1-\sqrt{v_G}.
$$

Then the **call** and **put** prices are

$$
\boxed{\;
C \;=\; e^{-rT}\Big(e^{\mu_G+\tfrac12 v_G}\,\Phi(d_1)\;-\;K\,\Phi(d_2)\Big)
\;}
$$

$$
\boxed{\;
P \;=\; e^{-rT}\Big(K\,\Phi(-d_2)\;-\;e^{\mu_G+\tfrac12 v_G}\,\Phi(-d_1)\Big)
\;}
$$

where $\Phi(\cdot)$ is the standard Normal CDF.

> You can also write it as a Black–Scholes price with
>
> $$
> S_0^{(G)} \;=\; \exp(\mu_G)=S_0\exp\!\Big((r-q-\tfrac12\sigma^2)\frac{T}{2}\Big),\quad

> $$
>
> applied to maturity $T$, discount $e^{-rT}$, and strike $K$, taking care that the drift adjustment already sits inside $S_0^{(G)}$.

# Discrete, equally spaced geometric average (also closed form)

If there are $n$ equally spaced fixings over $[0,T]$ (at $t_k=kT/n$), then

$$
\mu_G^{(n)} \;=\; \ln S_0 \;+\; \Big(r-q-\tfrac12\sigma^2\Big)\frac{T}{2}\,\frac{n+1}{n},
\qquad
v_G^{(n)} \;=\; \sigma^2 T \;\frac{(n+1)(2n+1)}{6n^2}.
$$

Use the **same** call/put formulas as above, replacing $\mu_G,v_G$ with $\mu_G^{(n)},v_G^{(n)}$.

## Notes & intuition

* For **arithmetic‑average Asians** there is **no** general closed form; this Kemna–Vorst result is for **geometric average** (continuous or discrete equal‑spacing).
* The effective volatility is reduced to $\sigma/\sqrt{3}$ (continuous case), capturing how averaging damps variability.
* Geometric‑average prices are excellent **control variates** for MC on arithmetic‑average Asians.

If you want, I can plug in your benchmark parameters (e.g., $S_0=100, K=100, r=5\%, q=0, \sigma=20\%, T=1$) and compute the numeric call/put values from the formula.

Good question — you already nailed most of the “core” parameters. Let’s go carefully and systematically, since pricing **Asian options** (path-dependent options) requires more than just the standard Black–Scholes input.

---

### 1. **Contract Parameters**

* **$S_0$**: spot price of the underlying at $t=0$
* **$K$**: strike price
* **$T$**: maturity (in years)
* **Option type**: call or put
* **Averaging type**:

  * **Arithmetic average** (most common, no closed form in general)
  * **Geometric average** (has a closed form under Kemna–Vorst)
* **Averaging style**:

  * **Discrete**: average over specific monitoring dates $\{t_1, \dots, t_M\}$
  * **Continuous**: average continuously over $[0,T]$
* **Payoff structure**: fixed strike (average vs strike) or floating strike (terminal price vs average)

---

### 2. **Market Parameters**

* **$r$**: risk-free interest rate
* **$q$** (if needed): dividend yield (or convenience yield for commodities)
* **$\sigma$**: volatility

---

### 3. **Simulation / Numerical Method Parameters**

Since you assume no closed form and want to simulate:

* **numPaths** ($N$): number of Monte Carlo simulations
* **numSteps** ($M$): number of time steps per path
* **Discretization scheme**:

  * Exact GBM stepper (preferred if GBM assumption holds)
  * Euler–Maruyama
  * Milstein (higher accuracy for diffusions with state-dependent vol)
* **Random number generator**:

  * IID Gaussians $Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$
  * Optionally, variance reduction: antithetic variates, control variates, quasi-Monte Carlo (Sobol sequences)

---

### 4. **Payoff Evaluation Details**

* **Averaging rule**: arithmetic mean

  $$
  \bar{S} = \frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^M S_{t_i}
  $$
* **Discounting**: payoff must be discounted back to present

  $$
  V_0 = e^{-rT} \, \mathbb{E}[\max(\bar{S} - K, 0)]
  $$
* **Estimator variance**: need confidence intervals for Monte Carlo results.

---

### 5. **Optional / Advanced Ingredients**

* **Control variates**: using the geometric average Asian as control for arithmetic Asian
* **Greeks computation**: if you need sensitivities (Delta, Vega, etc.) you may require pathwise derivatives or likelihood ratio methods
* **Convergence tolerance**: stop simulation when CI half-width < ε

---

✅ So, in short: beyond $(S_0, K, T, \sigma, r)$, you also need:

* option type (call/put, fixed/floating strike)
* averaging type (arithmetic/geometric, discrete/continuous, monitoring dates)
* simulation parameters (numPaths, numSteps, RNG, stepper scheme)
* implementation choices (variance reduction, confidence interval targets)

---

👉 Do you want me to write this as a **checklist of inputs for an actual Monte Carlo pricer** (like a constructor signature)? That might be most useful for your project.

Great—here’s the math you need, step‑by‑step, to justify and build a Crank–Nicolson (CN) solver for European options under your stated Black–Scholes (BS) assumptions.

# 1) From GBM to the pricing PDE (why a PDE exists and is unique)

**Assumptions (your framework):** frictionless markets, continuous trading, constant $r,\sigma$, no dividends ($q=0$), risk‑neutral measure $\mathbb{Q}$.

Under $\mathbb{Q}$:

$$
dS_t = r S_t\,dt + \sigma S_t\, dW_t .
$$

For a European payoff $\Phi(S_T)$, the no‑arbitrage price is the risk‑neutral expectation

$$
V(S,t)=\mathbb{E}^{\mathbb{Q}}\!\left[e^{-r(T-t)}\,\Phi(S_T)\,\middle|\,S_t=S\right].
$$

By **Feynman–Kac**, $V$ is the **unique** classical solution (with sufficient regularity) to the linear parabolic PDE

$$
\boxed{\;V_t + \tfrac12\sigma^2 S^2 V_{SS} + r S V_S - r V = 0,\qquad (S>0,\ 0\le t<T)\;}
$$

with terminal condition $V(S,T)=\Phi(S)$. This is the continuous object CN will approximate.

# 2) Domain truncation and boundary/terminal data

You solve on a truncated strip $[0,S_{\max}]\times[0,T]$.

* **Terminal condition (at $t=T$)**
  Call: $V(S,T)=\max(S-K,0)$.
  Put:  $V(S,T)=\max(K-S,0)$.

* **Boundary conditions (Dirichlet, no dividends)**
  As $S\downarrow 0$:
  Call $\to 0$ ⇒ $V(0,t)=0$.
  Put  $\to K e^{-r(T-t)}$ ⇒ $V(0,t)=K\,e^{-r(T-t)}$.

  As $S\to\infty$: linear asymptotes
  Call $V\sim S - K e^{-r(T-t)}$ ⇒ set $V(S_{\max},t)=S_{\max} - K e^{-r(T-t)}$.
  Put  $V\sim 0$ ⇒ $V(S_{\max},t)=0$.

Pick $S_{\max}$ big enough (e.g. $3S_0$–$5S_0$ or $4K$) so the truncation error is negligible.

# 3) Space–time grid and discrete differential operator

Uniform grid in $S$: $S_i=i\,\Delta S,\ i=0,\dots,M$ with $\Delta S=S_{\max}/M$.
Uniform grid in time (we step **backward**): $t_n = n\,\Delta t,\ n=0,\dots,N$ with $\Delta t = T/N$.
Let $V_i^n \approx V(S_i, t_n)$.

Discretize **spatial derivatives** at interior nodes $i=1,\dots,M-1$ with **centered differences**:

$$
V_S \approx \frac{V_{i+1}^n - V_{i-1}^n}{2\Delta S},\qquad
V_{SS} \approx \frac{V_{i+1}^n - 2V_i^n + V_{i-1}^n}{\Delta S^2}.
$$

Define the discrete **BS operator** $L$ acting on the spatial index $i$ (at a fixed time level) by

$$
(LV)_i = \alpha_i V_{i-1} + \beta_i V_i + \gamma_i V_{i+1},
$$

with coefficients (plug $S_i=i\Delta S$):

$$
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
\alpha_i &= \tfrac12\sigma^2 \frac{S_i^2}{\Delta S^2} - \tfrac12 r \frac{S_i}{\Delta S}
         = \tfrac12\sigma^2 i^2 - \tfrac12 r i,\\[2pt]
\beta_i  &= -\sigma^2 \frac{S_i^2}{\Delta S^2}-r
         = -\sigma^2 i^2 - r,\\[2pt]
\gamma_i &= \tfrac12\sigma^2 \frac{S_i^2}{\Delta S^2} + \tfrac12 r \frac{S_i}{\Delta S}
         = \tfrac12\sigma^2 i^2 + \tfrac12 r i.
\end{aligned}}
$$

# 4) Crank–Nicolson time stepping (why it’s good)

The continuous PDE can be written $V_t + L V = 0$. The **Crank–Nicolson** (CN) update from $t_{n+1}$ to $t_n$ (backward in time) is:

$$
\frac{V^n - V^{n+1}}{\Delta t} + \tfrac12\big(LV^n + LV^{n+1}\big) = 0
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
\boxed{\;(I - \tfrac12\Delta t\,L)\,V^n = (I + \tfrac12\Delta t\,L)\,V^{n+1}.}
$$

Properties:

* **Second‑order accurate** in both time and space (with the centered stencil): $O(\Delta t^2+\Delta S^2)$.
* **A‑stable** (unconditionally stable for linear parabolic PDEs), so you can take reasonably large $\Delta t$ without blow‑ups.
* Symmetric in time (midpoint rule), which reduces time‑discretization bias vs. pure implicit/explicit schemes.

# 5) Tridiagonal linear system (the exact coefficients you’ll code)

Writing the CN equation at node $i=1,\dots,M-1$ and grouping terms gives:

$$
- A_i\,V_{i-1}^n + (1 - B_i)\,V_i^n - C_i\,V_{i+1}^n
= A_i\,V_{i-1}^{n+1} + (1 + B_i)\,V_i^{n+1} + C_i\,V_{i+1}^{n+1},
$$

with

$$
\boxed{\;A_i=\tfrac12\Delta t\,\alpha_i,\quad B_i=\tfrac12\Delta t\,\beta_i,\quad C_i=\tfrac12\Delta t\,\gamma_i.}
$$

Using the $\alpha_i,\beta_i,\gamma_i$ above, that is

$$
A_i = \tfrac14\Delta t(\sigma^2 i^2 - r i),\quad
B_i = -\tfrac12\Delta t(\sigma^2 i^2 + r),\quad
C_i = \tfrac14\Delta t(\sigma^2 i^2 + r i).
$$

This yields a **tri‑diagonal** system for the interior vector $V^n_{1:M-1}$:

$$
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
1-B_1 & -C_1 &        &        \\
-A_2  & 1-B_2& -C_2   &        \\
      & \ddots&\ddots & \ddots \\
      &       & -A_{M-1}& 1-B_{M-1}
\end{bmatrix}}_{\text{LHS}}
\!
\begin{bmatrix}V_1^n\\ V_2^n\\ \vdots\\ V_{M-1}^n\end{bmatrix}
=
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
A_1 V_0^{n+1} + (1+B_1)V_1^{n+1} + C_1 V_2^{n+1}\\
\vdots\\
A_{M-2} V_{M-3}^{n+1} + (1+B_{M-2})V_{M-2}^{n+1} + C_{M-2}V_{M-1}^{n+1}\\
A_{M-1} V_{M-2}^{n+1} + (1+B_{M-1})V_{M-1}^{n+1} + C_{M-1} V_M^{n+1}
\end{bmatrix}}_{\text{RHS, known at step }n+1},
$$

where the boundary values $V_0^n, V_M^n$ (Dirichlet) are injected into the RHS at each step.

Solve this tridiagonal system (Thomas algorithm) to obtain $V^n$ from $V^{n+1}$.

# 6) Algorithm (end‑to‑end)

1. **Grid & coefficients:** choose $M,N,S_{\max}$, compute $\Delta S,\Delta t$, precompute $A_i,B_i,C_i$ for $i=1\dots M-1$.
2. **Initialize at maturity:** set $V_i^{N}=\Phi(S_i)$ for all $i$; set $V_0^{N},V_M^{N}$ with boundary formulas at $t=T$ (they match payoff).
3. **Backward time loop:** for $n=N-1,N-2,\dots,0$

   * Set boundary values $V_0^n, V_M^n$ using the **time‑dependent** Dirichlet conditions (they include $e^{-r(T-t_n)}$).
   * Assemble **RHS** from $V^{n+1}$ (and add the boundary contributions $A_1 V_0^n$, $C_{M-1}V_M^n$).
   * Solve the **tridiagonal** system for $V_{1:M-1}^n$.
4. **Interpolate** $V(S_0,0)$ from the grid (linear or higher‑order). Greeks from centered differences:

   $$
   \Delta \approx \frac{V_{i+1}^0-V_{i-1}^0}{2\Delta S},\quad
   \Gamma \approx \frac{V_{i+1}^0-2V_i^0+V_{i-1}^0}{\Delta S^2}.
   $$

# 7) Why CN “works” here (theoretical justification)

* The BS PDE is **linear parabolic** with smooth, bounded coefficients on the truncated strip; Feynman–Kac guarantees the PDE solution equals the risk‑neutral price.
* CN with centered space differences is **consistent** with the PDE (local truncation error $O(\Delta t^2+\Delta S^2)$), **A‑stable** (no CFL restriction), and the discrete operator is **M‑matrix‑like** for sufficiently fine grids (helps preserve monotonicity/no‑arbitrage numerically).
* With appropriate $S_{\max}$ and grid resolution (often non‑uniform grids concentrate points near $K$ for sharper Greeks), the CN solution **converges** to the BS value as $\Delta S,\Delta t\to 0$.

**Practical tip:** because the terminal payoff has a kink (non‑smooth at $S=K$), CN can show tiny oscillations for large $\Delta t$. A standard remedy is **Rannacher smoothing** (replace the first CN step by two half‑steps of fully implicit Euler). It preserves second‑order convergence thereafter.

---

That’s the full mathematical story: starting at the risk‑neutral expectation, Feynman–Kac ⇒ PDE, then CN discretization ⇒ a stable, second‑order, tridiagonal linear solve each time step. If you want, I can now map each boxed formula directly to coefficient names and lines in a minimal `PDE` class for your codebase.


Great, I’ve looked **very carefully** at your code base (`utilities.hpp/.cpp`, `main.cpp`). Let’s connect it to the theoretical excerpt you pasted.

---

## 1. Theoretical background recap

We’re dealing with the linear SDE:

$$
dX_t = \alpha X_t \,dt + \beta X_t \, dW_t
$$

* **Exact solution (strong solution)**

  $$
  X_t = X_0 \exp\!\left[\Big(\alpha - \tfrac12\beta^2\Big)t + \beta W_t\right].
  $$

* **Strong vs weak error**

  * **Strong convergence** cares about **pathwise accuracy**:

    $$
    \epsilon(h) = \mathbb{E}\!\left[|X_T - y_T^h|\right] = O(h^\gamma).
    $$

    i.e. how close the simulated trajectory is to the true one, for the same Brownian path.
  * **Weak convergence** cares about **distributional accuracy**:

    $$
    |\,\mathbb{E}[g(X_T)] - \mathbb{E}[g(y_T^h)]\,| = O(h^\beta).
    $$

    i.e. expectations of functions (payoffs, moments) are correct, even if paths are not.

---

## 2. How this relates to your code

Looking at your repo:

* In `utilities.cpp` you have **steppers**:

  * `GBM::advance()` → uses the **exact discrete-time law** of the GBM increment (so exact strong solution at the step level).
  * `Euler::advance()` → implements **Euler–Maruyama**:

    $$
    S_{t+dt} = S_t (1 + r\,dt + \sigma Z \sqrt{dt})
    $$

    Strong order $\gamma = 0.5$.
  * `Milstein::advance()` → Euler plus correction term $\tfrac12\sigma^2(Z^2-1)dt$.
    Strong order $\gamma = 1.0$.

* In `MonteCarlo::pricePath()` you simulate paths step by step using whichever stepper is chosen (GBM/Euler/Milstein).

  * Then you compute option payoffs, average them, possibly apply variance reduction (AV, CV).
  * This is **exactly the framework** where the definitions of strong and weak convergence apply.

* In `MonteCarlo::priceTerminal()` you bypass stepping altogether:

  * Directly call `Step::terminalDraw()` → exact closed-form sampling at maturity $T$.
  * Here the approximation error is **zero** (since GBM law is exactly sampled).

So:

* **Euler/Milstein steppers** correspond to *numerical approximations* where strong/weak convergence order matters.
* **GBM (exact)** corresponds to the *reference solution*—no numerical discretization error, only Monte Carlo sampling error.

---

## 3. Why use Euler/Milstein if we already have exact GBM?

This is the key point you asked.

👉 In your framework, for **vanilla Black–Scholes GBM**, you *do know* the exact dynamics, so `terminalDraw()` is enough. Euler/Milstein seem pointless.

But in **general SDEs**:

* For many processes (e.g. Heston, SABR, local volatility, stochastic interest rates), **no closed-form transition density** is available.
* You can’t do a one-step `terminalDraw()` because the exact distribution of $X_T$ is unknown.
* Then you **must discretize** the SDE:

  * Euler–Maruyama (simplest, strong order 0.5).
  * Milstein (better pathwise accuracy, strong order 1.0, but needs derivative of diffusion term).

So in practice:

* **Exact GBM stepper** = used only for GBM (nice for benchmarking, validation, variance reduction).
* **Euler/Milstein steppers** = *universal tools* for more complicated dynamics, where you don’t know the exact distribution.

That’s why textbooks emphasize strong/weak convergence—they tell you *how fast* your approximation improves as you refine the timestep.

---

✅ **Summary, in your project terms**:

* Your `Stepper` classes implement the **approximation scheme** in Definition 3.3/3.4.
* `Euler` = strong order 0.5, `Milstein` = strong order 1.0, `GBM` = exact.
* `MonteCarlo::pricePath` is the framework where you test these convergence properties.
* `priceTerminal` with GBM is the “truth” for benchmarking.
* Euler/Milstein are included because in real finance we rarely have an `exactGBM`—they prepare your codebase for general models.

---

Do you want me to also **map explicitly** which of your outputs (variance reduction tables, CI, etc.) correspond to **weak convergence diagnostics** vs **strong convergence diagnostics**?


Exactly ✅ — you’ve got it.

Let me unpack what that phrase means in practice:

---

### 1. **What “closed-form transition density” means**

* The **transition density** is the probability law of the state variable $X_t$ at a later time, given its current value.
  For GBM (Black–Scholes), it’s **Lognormal**:

  $$
  X_T \sim \text{Lognormal}\!\left(\ln S_0 + (r-\tfrac12\sigma^2)T,\; \sigma^2 T\right).
  $$

* This closed form allows you to do

  ```cpp
  ST = S0 * exp((r - 0.5*sigma^2)*T + sigma*sqrt(T)*Z);
  ```

  i.e. your `terminalDraw()`.

* For more complex SDEs (Heston, SABR, local vol), the law of $X_T$ is **not known in closed form**. You can’t just plug in a formula.

---

### 2. **Why we can’t do a one-step terminalDraw**

* If you don’t know the distribution of $X_T$, you **cannot sample directly at maturity**.
* You only know the **dynamics** (the drift + diffusion coefficients of the SDE).
* That forces you to **discretize time** into steps $\Delta t$ and build the path recursively using numerical schemes (Euler, Milstein, etc.).

So yes:

$$
X_0 \;\to\; X_{\Delta t} \;\to\; X_{2\Delta t} \;\to\; \cdots \;\to\; X_T,
$$

each step being approximate.

---

### 3. **Link to strong/weak convergence**

* The error of these approximations is measured by strong/weak convergence definitions.
* Euler–Maruyama: strong order 0.5.
* Milstein: strong order 1.0 (better pathwise accuracy).
* For weak convergence (expectations like option prices), Euler already gives order 1.

---

### 4. **So, long story short**

👉 Yes, **whenever you don’t know the exact distribution of $X_T$**, you must resort to **approximate stepping methods** (Euler/Milstein/etc.) to propagate the distribution from $0$ to $T$.

That’s why your framework includes Euler and Milstein alongside exact GBM:

* GBM = “benchmark with exact law”.
* Euler/Milstein = “generic approximators for real models”.

---

Do you want me to show you **a concrete example with Heston** (where you cannot write `terminalDraw()` and must use Euler), so you can see how your stepper class would be extended beyond GBM?

Here’s a concise “scope boundary” note you could paste into your report:

---

### Scope Boundary

The numerical framework developed in this project is restricted to the **geometric Brownian motion (GBM)** dynamics of the Black–Scholes model. In this setting, the exact transition law of the underlying is available in closed form, which allows for direct terminal sampling without discretization error.

The inclusion of **Euler–Maruyama** and **Milstein** steppers in the code serves a **benchmarking and pedagogical purpose**: they provide a way to study the notions of strong and weak convergence, and to compare approximate schemes against the exact GBM dynamics.

Extending the framework to more complex stochastic models (e.g. Heston, SABR, local volatility, stochastic interest rates) would require handling multi-dimensional state variables, correlated Brownian motions, and the absence of closed-form transition densities. Such extensions are outside the scope of this project.

---

Do you want me to also prepare a **one-sentence version** you can drop into slides for your presentation?

Exactly ✅ — you’ve nailed the distinction:

---

## 1. **Monte Carlo (sampling)**

* You are approximating an *expectation* by a finite sample average.
* The Monte Carlo estimator is **unbiased** (assuming no CV misuse etc.).
* The error shows up as **variability** around the true expectation:

  $$
  \hat V_N = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N Y_i,\qquad
  \text{Var}(\hat V_N) \sim \frac{\sigma^2}{N}.
  $$
* Convergence rate = $O(N^{-1/2})$.
* This is **not a bias**, just noise that shrinks with more paths or variance reduction.

👉 In your tables: the **95% CI width** is entirely Monte Carlo error.

---

## 2. **Stepper (time discretization)**

* If the model has no closed-form transition (e.g. general SDE), you approximate its dynamics with Euler/Milstein.
* Then you are no longer sampling the true distribution of $S_T$, but an *approximate* one.
* This introduces **bias** that depends on the step size $h$:

  * Strong error: pathwise bias \~ $O(h^\gamma)$.
  * Weak error: expectation bias \~ $O(h^\beta)$.

👉 With GBM stepper, your `advance()` uses the *exact* transition — so **no bias**.
👉 With Euler/Milstein, yes, there is discretization bias (which vanishes as $h \to 0$).

---

## 3. Putting them together

So for a European option in your framework:

* **GBM terminalDraw** →
  Bias = 0 (exact distribution).
  Error = only Monte Carlo variability + floating-point noise.

* **GBM full-path (with exact step)** →
  Same: bias = 0 (because each step is exact).
  Error = only Monte Carlo variability.

* **Euler/Milstein** →
  Bias = nonzero (discretization).
  Error = Monte Carlo variability **+** discretization bias.
  As you refine dt, the bias shrinks at known order (0.5 / 1.0).

---

✅ **So the clean separation is:**

* **MC error** → variability (random noise, decays with more paths, no bias).
* **Stepper error** → bias (systematic, depends on dt, goes away only as dt→0).

---

Do you want me to also sketch a little diagram showing the **two error axes** (MC noise vs discretization bias) so you can use it in your report/presentation?
